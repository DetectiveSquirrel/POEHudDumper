POEHud Dumper
======

## Preload Dumper
###Why I made it?
Dont really know but people can use it to find all preload data nice and cleanly and is stored locally every area

###When does it run?
When PoEHud detects an area change

###Settings
When `Dump Preload Data` is enabled it will dump all preload strings sorted alphabetically and saved like https://pastebin.com/raw/gBhFiRdq
Example of folder structure: `"PoE HUD\Preload Dumps\17-08-2017\The Sarn Encampment (33)\11.34.48 PM The Sarn Encampment (33).txt"`
`File extensions` can be excluded from logging by enabling/disabling them under File Extensions menus, sorted aplhabetically
